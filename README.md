This repo consist of two parts. First an Arduino program to controll a **8x8** LED matrix using 16 pins from an Arduino UNO (led_matrix_8x8_control folder).
Finally a program where you can generate characters for the LCD using an interactive UI made with **JavaScript** (Matrix_8x8_char_generator folder).
